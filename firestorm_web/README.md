### An open-source forum engine, with an Elixir+Phoenix backend and an Elm frontend.
#### A community-funded project from [DailyDrip](https://www.dailydrip.com).

This is an orphan branch for the starting point of the Firestorm Forum episodes
on [DailyDrip Elixir Topic](https://www.dailydrip.com/topics/elixir). There's
already a working version of the forum in the master branch, but this allows us
to build it from scratch for learning purposes.

## Patrons

All of the patrons that made it possible are listed in [the PATRONS
